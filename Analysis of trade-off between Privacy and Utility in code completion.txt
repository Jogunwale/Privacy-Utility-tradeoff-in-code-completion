The results show a clear trade-off between the level of code obfuscation and the balance between privacy and utility in code completion. As shown in the scatter plot, the original and low obfuscation prompts cluster at a privacy score of ). This shows the low obfuscation has no meaningful effect on privacy whilst also having no change on utility. This is seen with their identical privacy and utility scores of 0.0000 and 0.1423 respectively.
On the other hand, we see high obfuscation’s more substantial changes by removing comments, docstrings and renaming identifiers has a much higher average privacy score of 0.7825. in addition, even with the privacy increase, there is a marginally higher average utility of 0.1480. This suggests that the model is still capable of producing relevant completions even when the contextual information is heavily reduced. There is greater variance in the utility of high obfuscation which shows some reduced consistency (compared to low obfuscation) in output quality even with the improved privacy.
Overall, the results suggest that strong obfuscation have a significant impact in improving privacy whilst not hindering utility on average. We see that low obfuscation is quite useless as privacy remains and 0 with no change in utility. Practically, we can see organisations may benefit significantly from high obfuscation for sensitive content and it most likely wouldn’t hinder output quality. That increased variability is the only potential shortcoming.
